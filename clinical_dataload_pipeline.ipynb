The study consists of 5 single dosing occasions, and a five day repeated dose period.\\n\\nPart 1 Single Dosing:\\n\\nFour parallel groups of 11 subjects will participate in the oral single dosing, dose escalation study phase. In each group, subjects will be randomly assigned so that eight subjects receive active and three subjects receive placebo. It is planned for Groups 1 and 2, that a staggered 'sentinel' dose design will be used, with two sub-groups:\\n\\n* The first will comprise of one placebo and one active subject.\\n* In the second, seven subjects will receive active and two will receive placebo after a review of the 24 h post-dose safety data of the first group.\\n\\nSentinel subject dosing will be performed in higher-dose groups if there is no measurable plasma GWP42006 in Group 1 or 2.\\n\\nOne group within the single dosing part (Group 3/dose level 3) will then receive an intravenous administration of 5 mg GWP42006 to allow assessment of bioavailability. There will be a minimum of seven days between doses.\\n\\nUp to three further groups may be added for further evaluations, e.g. to assess additional dose levels or food effect. The need for additional groups will be based on a review of the safety, tolerability and PK data by the safety advisory committee.\\n\\nDose Escalation:\\n\\nThe planned dose levels are 25 mg (Group 1/dose level 1), 75 mg (Group 2/dose level 2), 200 mg (Group 3/dose level 3) and 400 mg (Group 4/dose level 4), with a maximum dose of 800 mg. Administration of each successive dose will be dependent on safety, tolerability and PK data of previous doses.\\n\\nPart 2 Multiple Dosing:\\n\\nThe doses and dose regimens assessed in Part 2 will be selected based upon the safety, and PK data from Part 1 of the study.\\n\\nIt is planned that one group of 11 subjects will participate in the multiple dose phase, and subjects will be randomly assigned so that eight subjects receive active and three receive matching placebo. Each subject will receive the selected dose of GWP42006 or placebo once, twice or three times daily for a total of five days, with the final dose administered on the morning of Day 5.\\n\\nUp to two further groups may be added for further evaluations, e.g. to assess a different dose level or a different dosing frequency. As for single dosing, the decision to include further groups will be taken based on safety, tolerability and PK data. All further groups would be added on blinded information.\"\n",

However, data is still limited and requires further research prior to widespread adoption. Unfortunately, therapies such as PRP injections are being widely used without clinical evidence demonstrating its safety or effectiveness for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. 2-7 To date, there are no treatments that address the underlying cause of endothelial dysfunction, although low-intensity shockwave therapy for ED has shown promising results. Platelet-derived therapies targeting inflammation and promoting tissue/nerve regeneration and may represent a potential treatment option towards this direction. The investigators propose to perform Canada's first pilot RCT to evaluate and safety and efficacy of PRP for the treatment of ED.\",\n",
            "          \"detailedDescription\": \"The proposed study is a prospective, double-blinded, randomized placebo-controlled trial. This study will take place at the Manitoba Men's Health Clinic (Winnipeg, MB, Canada). All patients will undergo blood sampling in a 60 ml syringe containing 8 mL of anticoagulant. Patients will receive 2 treatments 1 month apart. Preparation of PRP and placebo injections will occur in a separate room. Samples of patients in the placebo arm will be discarded and sample of those randomized to the PRP group will be processed via an FDA-approved platelet separator (Magellan Autologous Platelet Separator; Arteriocyte Medical Systems, Hopkinton, MA) to yield approximately 10 mL of PRP. Once prepared, the patient will be placed in the supine position with a tourniquet placed around the base of the penis. A total of 5 mL will be infused in each corpus cavernosum - slowly retracting the needle for better distribution of PRP into the erectile tissue - over a 2-minute period. The whole procedure will be performed under sterile conditions. Following administration, additional compression of the penis will be performed with a dressing placed around the penile shaft. The penile tourniquet will be removed 20 minutes after the injections and patients are released. The placebo group will include a sterile saline injection. Follow-Up Procedures and Evaluations: Follow-up visits will be conducted at months: 1, 3, 6, after the last treatment session and shall include: Measuring IIEF-EF of patients at the clinic at every follow-up visit, as well as reporting and recording adverse events.\"\n",

            "          \"detailedDescription\": \"Perioperative anxiety in children is a common multifactorial influenced and triggered entity with an incidence as high as 50%. Especially (mask)induction of anesthesia is considered one of the most stressful experiences for a child undergoing surgery. A common practice worldwide to diminish the level of anxiety prior to anesthesia is premedication with the benzodiazepine midazolam in order to improve cooperation during induction.\\n\\nPremedication with midazolam has a primary purpose to reduce preoperative anxiety and has inherent to a benzodiazepine its sedative effects. Although these effects are implied, negative effects of premedication: respiratory complications, paradoxical negative behavior has been reported. Although alternative medications have been studied, studies for non-pharmacological anxiety-reduction remain limited.\\n\\nNon-pharmacological anxiety-reduction by distraction including Tablet or IPAD-multimedia might be a readily available alternative for midazolam premedication. Potentially limiting the use of psychoactive agents, limiting the need for preoperative sedation and therefore possibly decrease secondary respiratory complications in pediatric surgical day-care.\\n\\nObjective:\\n\\nThe first goal of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety between anxiolysis by multimedia-distraction with an IPAD versus anxiolysis by premedication with midazolam prior to the mask-induction of anesthesia.

As with any chemotherapy, paclitaxel is associated with unpleasant side effects. We are doing this study to try and understand what is happening in cancer cells in different individuals after paclitaxel treatment that make them respond differently to the same treatment. We hope that this study will enable us to develop a method to identify women who are suitable for this form of treatment. We also want to understand why some cancer cells don't get killed with paclitaxel. This information will help us to select treatment to suit an individual patient, and thus improve the outcome of treatment and avoid giving treatment that will not benefit the patient.\"\n",

Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 groups.\\n\\n* Group 1 (enrolled during months 1-8): Patients undergo pain and fatigue assessment periodically by demographic and treatment data, Quality of life-Patient Tool, BQII, Piper Fatigue Scale, Pain and Fatigue Knowledge Tools, and Patient Satisfaction Tool. Patients receive usual care and undergo pain and fatigue evaluation with no algorithms or formal education. Research nurses conduct chart audits to identify professional and system barriers but receive no medical education, peer review, or feedback. Medical professionals undergo assessment periodically by a Demographic Data Tool, Pain and Fatigue Knowledge Tools, Chart Audit Tool, and Provider Satisfaction.\\n* Group 2 (enrolled during months 9-30): Patients and medical professionals are assessed periodically as in group 1. Patients undergo a high-intensity Passport intervention with algorithms based on National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, pain and fatigue education once weekly for 4 weeks, and follow-up reinforcement phone calls every 2 weeks. Research nurses conduct chart audits of congruence between practice and guidelines, tape education sessions, and receive feedback from the principal investigator in the form of a Tape-Monitoring Checklist. Medical oncologists attend training on the use of the algorithms, peer review pain and fatigue management audit with feedback, and reinforce and apply content in clinical rounds.\\n* Group 3 (enrolled during months 34-57): Patients and medical professionals are assessed periodically as in group 1. Patients undergo a low-intensity Passport intervention as in group 2. Medical professionals conduct realistic implementation of the intervention into existing systems and procedures within the cancer center, less direct education and system intervention, and share group 2 experiences.\\n\\nAfter completion of study intervention, patients are followed at 1 and 3 months.\"\n",

Observed data will be collected from the visits and assessments conducted as part of the routine standard of care (SOC) follow-up of these patients. In addition, given the variability in SOC and timing of follow-up visits across institutions, if study required assessments do not coincide with a routine SOC visit at the institution, blood draws and other study-specific assessments will be collected at defined time points for the study analysis.\\n\\nAll participants who meet the eligibility criteria and stabilize following a hepatic decompensation event will have their clinical course followed for up to 96 weeks.\"\n",

However, data is still limited and requires further research prior to widespread adoption. Unfortunately, therapies such as PRP injections are being widely used without clinical evidence demonstrating its safety or effectiveness for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. 2-7 To date, there are no treatments that address the underlying cause of endothelial dysfunction, although low-intensity shockwave therapy for ED has shown promising results.

Samples of patients in the placebo arm will be discarded and sample of those randomized to the PRP group will be processed via an FDA-approved platelet separator (Magellan Autologous Platelet Separator; Arteriocyte Medical Systems, Hopkinton, MA) to yield approximately 10 mL of PRP.

A total of 5 mL will be infused in each corpus cavernosum - slowly retracting the needle for better distribution of PRP into the erectile tissue - over a 2-minute period. The whole procedure will be performed under sterile conditions. Following administration, additional compression of the penis will be performed with a dressing placed around the penile shaft. The penile tourniquet will be removed 20 minutes after the injections and patients are released. The placebo group will include a sterile saline injection.

The study consists of 5 single dosing occasions, and a five day repeated dose period.\\n\\nPart 1 Single Dosing:\\n\\nFour parallel groups of 11 subjects will participate in the oral single dosing, dose escalation study phase. In each group, subjects will be randomly assigned so that eight subjects receive active and three subjects receive placebo. It is planned for Groups 1 and 2, that a staggered 'sentinel' dose design will be used, with two sub-groups:\\n\\n* The first will comprise of one placebo and one active subject.\\n* In the second, seven subjects will receive active and two will receive placebo after a review of the 24 h post-dose safety data of the first group.\\n\\nSentinel subject dosing will be performed in higher-dose groups if there is no measurable plasma GWP42006 in Group 1 or 2.\\n\\nOne group within the single dosing part (Group 3/dose level 3) will then receive an intravenous administration of 5 mg GWP42006 to allow assessment of bioavailability. There will be a minimum of seven days between doses.\\n\\nUp to three further groups may be added for further evaluations, e.g. to assess additional dose levels or food effect. The need for additional groups will be based on a review of the safety, tolerability and PK data by the safety advisory committee.\\n\\nDose Escalation:\\n\\nThe planned dose levels are 25 mg (Group 1/dose level 1), 75 mg (Group 2/dose level 2), 200 mg (Group 3/dose level 3) and 400 mg (Group 4/dose level 4), with a maximum dose of 800 mg. Administration of each successive dose will be dependent on safety, tolerability and PK data of previous doses.\\n\\nPart 2 Multiple Dosing:\\n\\nThe doses and dose regimens assessed in Part 2 will be selected based upon the safety, and PK data from Part 1 of the study.\\n\\nIt is planned that one group of 11 subjects will participate in the multiple dose phase, and subjects will be randomly assigned so that eight subjects receive active and three receive matching placebo. Each subject will receive the selected dose of GWP42006 or placebo once, twice or three times daily for a total of five days, with the final dose administered on the morning of Day 5.\\n\\nUp to two further groups may be added for further evaluations, e.g. to assess a different dose level or a different dosing frequency.
